## Project Description

_Thanksgiving can be a stressful time; spending time with family you hardly see, or know, have the expectation of carrying on an engaging conversation lasting the whole feast. Luckily with this chat app you can practice! You can either ask questions or answer in a message thread about different topics, sorting out your thought. So when you are inquired about the most existential question, you have an answer._

## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 


```
{data: {} }
```


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

- Find and use external api through google.
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page


#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api through google.
- have a topic section
- have a conversation 
- have styling
- MERN
- CRUD
- socketsIO


#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add localStorage or firebase for storage
- userAuthentication
- ReactNative



## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router|
| nav | will take people to topics|
| Topic | this will be what the component the hosts the topic of conversation|
| Comments | the user will be able to comment on what the topic of conversation is|
| messaging | here is a messaging place to comments |





Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
